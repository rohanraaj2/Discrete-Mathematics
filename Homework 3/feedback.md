Things that I learned in doing this assignment
-

- How to express a problem in the predicate and propositional logic.
- Obtained deeper understanding of matrix representation.
- How to validate an argument.
- How to write proofs.
- How to prove equivalence relations through different methods and how to recognize them.
- How to prove partial orders through different methods and how to recognize them.
- application of proof techniques to prove mathematical statements
- Hasse's diagram
- how to do a fruitful collaboration on homework 3 solutions with my partner.
- coding on overleaf
- "got to learn a few new things."
- the correct use of quantifiers, rules of inference, proofs techniques, and translating situations into predicate logic
- Learned exactly what logic is and what functions are.
- Teamwork and alot of working under stress.

The homework can be improved as follows
-

- 10 questions should be the maximum limit. Questions more than that take out the fun in homework's and make them boring, time consuming and hectic(at least for me)
- 4(b) could do better at clarifying what it was looking for. Maybe more context would make it even better.
- A few new concepts(not delivered in the class) should be added.
- Arrange problems with the level of difficulty
- By having a review class for this particular homework.
- By not having as many proof questions which gets tiring to write in LaTeX.
- By teaching us pre-hand on how to type on LaTex.
- Everything was good this time. It was great that we almost had 1 month to solve this h.w
- I enjoyed doing the sherlock holmes mystery question and even question 1, I would very much like to do similar brain puzzling (mind exercising) questions.
- by giving slightly easier questions
- by reducing the number of parts in every question.
- some hints could help at some tricky questions
- Previous ungraded practice would have helped.
- Questions providing more information as to what is required.
- The inference part should be removed from this homework and included to the predicate logic one homework. Then, increase the number of questions on relation and ordering in my opinion.
- This homework can be improved if all the questions were made interesting by using a relatable scenario to explain the question. The Sherlock Holmes question is a good example.
- This homework was nicely constructed and needs no further improvement
- Would've loved to see more questions related to theorems and proofs in number theory.

Other feedback
-

- it was interesting to see how DM skills can help in detective skills.
- understood to a great extent about relations and orders by searching stuff online and even the course book which helped me do the questions
- i think i can solve questions with various proof techniques now
- I was able to develop deeper understanding of different types of relations and their examples as well as basic logic and inference.
- Interesting questions on Inference proved how the bookish language/semantics are very much applicable in real world logic based problems.
- I think it was good and challenging.
- it was me who needs to start working earlier and develop a stronger work ethic.
- every question tested a different concept.
- Please no more latex :(. My hands hurt from reaching the "\" symbol over and over again.
- This homework challenged students in every way possible to have them grasp a better understanding of the concepts.
