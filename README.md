-------

# Purpose and Background

This homework provides practice in
- writing statements in propositional logic
- combining propositions using logical connectives
- proving logical identities using truth tables
- proving logical identities using known identities
- converting between logical notation and English sentences
- applying inference or implication
- assessing the correctness of an argument
- the use of propositional functions
- the impact of the domain on a propositional function
- the use of quantifiers
- expressing predicate logic statements in natural language and vice versa
- applying negation to quantifiers
- evaluating the truth value of propositions involving quantifiers

# Previous Feedback

Feedback from the previous set of students who attempted this assignment is summarized in the accompanying file, `feedback.md`.

Based on it, some questions have been re-worded for clarity, some questions are broken down into parts, and some LaTeX code is provided in the solutions. 

# Submission
Submission is in 2 parts and you have to complete __both__ of them. Not submitting any of them will result in a loss of marks. Both are due simultaneously. Please make sure to submit well in time. There is __no late submission__. Please talk to your instructor in advance if you are at risk of missing the deadline.

## HW 2.1 Problem Set
Write your solutions in the _same_ LaTeX file, `hw2.tex`, as provided and push the completed file to your team's repository. The files in the repository at the time of the deadline will be taken as your team's submission. Make sure that any included files, e.g. image files, are present in the repository. Files that do not compile cannot be graded. So it is best to work with a local installation of LaTeX and use VS Code for collaboration with your buddy.

This is a __team submission__, i.e. a single submission per team. Your team has a single repository to which each of you will have access. Your team submission will be assigned a __Submission Score__ based on the correctness of the contained solutions.

Deadline: 2359h on Mon, 21 Feb

## HW 2.2 Feedback Form
Fill out the feedback form that will be made available under the Assignments module on the course page on Canvas.

This is an __individual submission__, i.e. each of you has to fill the form. Filling the form contributes to your __Team Factor__ which is 1 by default and is penalized in case of non-submission of the form,  misreporting feedback, or unequal contribution to the submission as reported by your buddies and/or the commit history on GitHub.

Deadline: 2359h on Wed, 21 Feb

# Grading

Your score in the assignment is the product of your Submission Score and Team Factor.

# Outside Resources
It is okay to consult and use outside resources as long as they are duly cited in your submission. Not mentioning them will be seen as a case of passing outside work as your own which is a case of academic dishonesty.

# Discussion

In case of confusion or lack of clarity, do not hesitate to reach out to the course staff. We also encourage you to

- discuss with your buddy,
- post in the discussion thread linked in the Assignment module on the course page on Canvas.

There is a lot to take in and it is natural to get confused. Do not feel shy to reach out for help or clarification in a timely manner.
