\question This question refers to the \textit{tiling} or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation}{\textit{tessellation}} operation.
  
  \begin{minipage}{0.5 \linewidth}
    Given a standard checkerboard and dominoes, answer the following questions. Explain your answer for each question.
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width= 0.15\textwidth]{dominos}
    \end{center}
  \end{minipage} 
  \begin{minipage}{0.5 \linewidth}\begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=0.6 \textwidth]{checkerboard} \end{center}
  \end{minipage}
  \begin{parts}
  \part[5] Can we tile the standard checkerboard using dominoes?
    \begin{solution}
      % Write your solution here
      Yes, it is possible to do it. The checkerboard is made out of 8x8 tiles which is 64 
      \newline which is an even number. The dominos are made up of two tiles and their cardiality
      \newline is even too. Therefore, $64/2 = 32$. So, exactly 32 dominos will be needed. It is upto
      \newline us if we want to place all of them vertically or horizontally.
    \end{solution}
    
  \part[5] Can we tile a checkerboard obtained by removing one of the four corner squares of a standard checkerboard?
    \begin{solution}
      % Write your solution here
      No, we cannot do that. Removing 1 tile will leave behind 63 tiles which is an odd number.
      \newline Since no domino is overlapped or broken into single tiles, it is not possible.
    \end{solution}
    
  \part[5] Can we tile a board obtained by removing both the upper left and the lower right squares of a standard checkerboard? 
    \begin{solution}
      % Write your solution here
      No it is not possible. Although now we have 62 tiles which is even, the places of
      \newline tiles missing is not next to each other and the domino can only fill up space in pairs of 2 and
      \newline cannot be broken. Therefore this cannot be done.
    \end{solution}
  \end{parts}

\question[10]
  The following is a murder case solved by Sherlock Holmes, in “A Study
  in Scarlet” :\\
  \textit{“And now we come to the great question as to the reason why. Robbery
    has not been the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it
    politics, then, or was it a woman?  That is the question which confronted
    me. I was inclined from the first to the latter supposition. Political
    assassins are only too glad to do their work and fly. This murder had, on
    the contrary, been done most deliberately, and the perpetrator has left
    his tracks all over the room, showing he had been
    there all the time.”}\\
  From these, Sherlock Holmes concluded: ``It was a woman''.  Translate the
  above argument to statements in predicate logic and prove its validity.
  \begin{solution}
    % Write your solution here
    p = Robbery was not the object of the murder
    \newline q = nothing was taken
    \newline r = it is politics
    \newline s = it is woman
    \newline t = assassin does his work, leaves immediately and leaves no marks
    (1) $p \implies q$ (premise) 
    \newline (2) $r \lor s$ (premise)
    \newline (3) $r \implies t$ (premise)
    \newline (4) $ \neg t$ (premise)
    \newline (5) $\neg r$ (Modus Tollens with 3 and 4)
    \newline $\therefore s$ (Disjunctive Syllogism with 2 and 5)

  \begin{EnvUplevel}
    Let $R$ be a relation from a set A to a set B. The \textit{inverse relation} from $B$ to $A$, denoted by $R^{-1}$, is the set of ordered pairs $\{(b, a) \mid (a, b) \in R\}$. The \textit{complementary relation} $\overline{R}$ is the set of ordered pairs $\{(a, b) \mid (a, b) \not\in R\}$. A relation $R$ on the set $A$ is \textit{irreflexive} if $\forall a \in A\colon (a, a) \not\in R$. That is, $R$ is irreflexive if no element in $A$ is related to itself.
