Things that I learned in doing this assignment
-

- Applications of Graphs and Functions, Mathematical Proofs, properties of graphs, and Theorems
- Isomorphic and bipartite graphs and their properties.
- Hall's Theorem and its application."
- fruitful collaboration on proofs and techniques related to the above topics.
- improved my team work skills and communication skills while doing this homework.
- How matching can help simplify problems
- how to draw a bipartite graph on Latex.
- how to write proofs using proof techniques
- how can we use graphs in logics.
- Coding on overleaf.
- graphs and how to put them in latex
- "basically interesting maths."
- using pigeon-hole principle for proofs.
- teamwork and a whole lot of stress due to latex
- that the state of being lackadaisical is way more wiser.

The homework can be improved as follows
-

- It seemed fine to me.
- Maybe an example to tricky questions would help understand how to go about them?- "
- Not required to be on latex
- Questions 9 and 10 were unclear
- I did not get how detailed my answer should be for question 1."
- One thing which I would mention that we have been through proofing questions alot, I believe there is a room to change the question is a way that helps student to use all the concepts and imagine a problem happening in daily life.
- A little more time should have been given
- "Already a great homework."
- Better worded proofs
- By helping us on how to write in LaTex befoe hand.
- By providing images as it makes it easier to understand the question properly
- fewer questions could have been given.
- I think this homework was pretty straight forward it could probably be improved by having more Habib related questions like the Ehsas center one.
- I would like the questions to be arranged inorder of difficulty.
- If more graphs questions were included it would have made the homework more interesting to do.
- It could be improved if covid wasn't a thing and I didn't have to schedule dozens of zoom meetings
- It didn't require any improvements, although I thought the questions were less or Maybe thats because we did 14-15 Qs in the previous HW
- It was boring to attempt
- It's too many different topics in one homework
- more focus on difficult matching problems.
- More practise being given in class and simple questions
- More questions maybe. Or some tougher ones.
- Provide more time to finish it
- This was my favourite homework, not much I can think of.
- Time duration can be increased
- With an example of bipartite graph being drawn on LaTeX, as it took me very long to figure out how to format it for question 6.
- Would have liked doing some more proofs, as the questions were really fun

Other feedback
-

- I enjoyed this one more than other assignments
- It was great to work under pressure
- Questions were really balanced in this homework, in terms of difficulty and size.
- Some optional to read or attend latex guidance could really be used by a few people, including me who just learned before the last question of this course that you can switch likes with \\ instead of typing whole \newline .
- the display of immaculate character leads to prosperity but external factors always pinch like a needle into the abdomen of an ethereal bird trynna escape the pandemonium perhaps.
- The latex part in this hw was the hardest.
- was an interesting homework, really made me think about how to prove certain things, was fun
- Induction was always my strong part :)"
- Applications of theorems in Graph theory in real life tell how useful they are even in simple situations
- i can now apply different proof techniques to solve mathematical statements
- It helped in intellectual growth, particularly the graph part was exciting.
- it was good practice of modeling suitable problems using graphs and combinatorics and apply known theorems on the models. it also provided practice for solving problems related to functions
- while doing it. It helped me understand some of the concepts more clearly
- This homework was the best of all as questions were not that difficult and moreover this was done on time as there were less questions to attempt.
- I think it was a very well thought assignment which tested all the required abilities to do the questions of above mentioned topics. All the questions and parts were given the deserved weightage. We were also given enough time.
