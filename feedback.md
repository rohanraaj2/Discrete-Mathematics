Things that I learned in doing this assignment
-

- writing statements in propositional logic
- combining propositions using logical connectives
- proving logical identities using truth tables
- proving logical identities using known identities
- converting between logical notation and English sentences
- applying inference or implication
- assessing the correctness of an argument
- the use of propositional functions
- the impact of the domain on a propositional function
- the use of quantifiers
- expressing predicate logic statements in natural language and vice versa
- applying negation to quantifiers
- evaluating the truth value of propositions involving quantifiers
- utilizing latex for neat mathematical equations.
- thinking a little more logically
- Practicing the knowledge of the logic topic was able to apply it onto everyday examples some of which were included in the hw.
- got a chance to collaborate on the solution and work in teams.

There was also [this](https://web.yammer.com/main/threads/eyJfdHlwZSI6IlRocmVhZCIsImlkIjoiMTEwMjg2NDkyMjc4Nzg0MCJ9).

The homework can be improved as follows
-

- questions should be more related to computer science or related subjects
- if it wasn't due on the same day as exams.
- Different team.
- please remove the pathetic, bane to my existence, LaTex
- by decreasing the number of questions or maybe by adding a few multiple choice questions
- if were we taught how to draw truth tables or type logic notation during recitations
- More numericals
- give us some hints for the tough questions
- More detailed working
- More frequent but shorter homeworks
- Provide example solutions to some questions
- Should include proofs questions more related to predicate logic.
- Should've had separate deadlines for each section of the HW (2 parts)
- we work close to the deadline so TA sessions should be held on the weekend
- by first giving basic questions to have basic concepts cleared and then tough questions to have a good grip over the topics.
- I think the assignment shouldn't be in pairs but rather individual

Other feedback
-

- This opened my brain on how to think logically and how simple things sometimes boggle your mind.
- it would probably be more exiting to work with a new partner every homework
- I think it was good in every way. Not long not short, just the right length and challenging questions to improve our efficiency.
- The homework is well designed. For this homework, I feel like the load was sufficient.
- The hw exercises were largely enjoyable and forced one to think and ponder.
- I suffered with the translation of predicate logic and vice versa including nested quantifiers.
