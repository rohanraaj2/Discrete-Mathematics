Things that I learned in doing this assignment
-

- a lot about what latex is and how it works.
- how to correctly apply proof techniques to prove mathematical statements
- using logic to solve set related questions
- collaborating with my partner.
- learned solving problems related to sets, relations, and some of the proofs.
- using venn diagrams to represent sets.
- learned many new things in latex, though i didn't enjoy that much as it gave me a bit headache
- learned that proving basic logic in sets is quite hard and worked hard to overcome using the methods taught
- Learned more about set relations and how to manipulate notation to provide proof.
- learned about set identities, cardinality, unions, intersections, and subsets.
- Using set identities to prove certain statements"
- we attempted the Questions and cross-checked the answers with each other which helped in getting to know about different approaches/point of view
- learned different set notations, functions and identities.
- learned to apply the knowledge of basic set operations to common problems.

The homework can be improved as follows
-

- We should have been given some instructions as to how we have to use latex.
- rubrics could've been helpful. But I think after the first grading we'll understand and adjust to how we are to be graded; it was sometimes confusing as to how we might be graded for certain questions."
- Giving pointers related to specific questions on how to approach them.
- maybe try to give some practice questions before, as i think it was a pretty great jump doing this homework after taking those asynchronous lectures
- More time and a little more guidance in the form of intro to proofs
- Instructions for uploading solutions to github were not that clear to me at least.
- Some of the questions were not elaborate enough, and so we had difficulties comprehending them.
- Reduce the number of Questions
- All questions were marked for 5 points, assigning the questions marks depending on the difficulty/length of the solution helps us tailor our approach to the question.
- making sure the questions are even in number making its easier to divided work.
- Maybe deadline can be extended a bit.
- The proofs need to be more clear and to the point.
- It may start from something really basic and then gradually the difficulty level should increase.
- The first assignment could have been unmarked, on a trial basis, so that we could see how it is marked and where we could improve.
- Let students choose their partners themselves for the homework assignments.
- questions on cardinality could be added.
- more questions with simpler solutions
- by giving more easier questions.
- Add some tough questions

Other feedback
-

- the problems were a bit difficult
- working in teams was fun and helped brainstorm and play around with different ideas.
- I think that the homework questions were made very well and covered most of the concepts we have learned in class
- The assignment was a good practice of solving problems related to sets.
- it tested our reasoning and logic a significant amount
- the homework was good as it was not too long and not too difficult.
- Good thought provoking questions provided.
- I hope I will get some new teammate soon!
- Overall had alot of fun doing the homework, funny enough I am actually looking forward to the next one, would love to see even more proofing questions in coming homework assignments."
- I like this approach of HW. Usually, homework isn't done in teams unless it is a project. Maybe it is more helpful in this course as it requires much more logic.
- I think the homework was pretty good
